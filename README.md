# PomodoroCity

This is a game where you play by doing productive work for 25 minutes and afterwards you'll be rewared with some pomodoro currency which you can use to build a city. As the city grows the population will increase. The city will easily show you how much time you are spending on your work.

## Instructions:
To play you press anywhere on the screen and the timer will start. When the timer reaches zero you will hear a gong sound which indicates it's time for a break. When break is over it's back to work. When you are finished working you can build a house by writing the name of the house and add it as a button. This is something you can use to keep track of how much time you are spending on that particular subject. At the moment there are only 3 different subjects you can keep track of. Of course you can use more but it will make it harder to keep track of the time spent on the project.

### History/Vision

I built a pomodoro application since I started reading up on the pomodoro technique and thought it would be a good exercise for my coding skills. I wanted this game to be like farmville but instead of farming crops you farmed pomodoro's to build stuff in the game.
